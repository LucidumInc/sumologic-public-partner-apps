# Gigamon Hawk ThreatINSIGHT

MetaStream with signals provide raw events, detections, observations, and ATR-defined aggregations  from ThreatINSIGHT in an AWS S3 bucket provisioned by Gigamon. This is critical when data is required for further analysis with other datasets for correlation purposes via other security tools in an ecosystem, most commonly being a Security Information and Event management (SIEM). All data and context can be seen in the SOCâ€™s main platform of choice to make quick decisions with less pivots. If the security analyst is only interested in detections and/or observations, or aggregations, that data may be retrieved  from using MetaStream Signals. MetaStream with Signals provide access to traffic metadata directly from sensors deployed as well as other alert data seen in ThreatINSIGHT. This feature allows access to an AWS S3 bucket that contains all events, detections, and observations, and ATR-defined event aggregations associated with the account.
