The Cyral App for Sumo Logic provides dashboards and visualizations for Cyral customers that have chosen to send their logs to the Sumo Logic platform.

# Documentation
First, you will need to [Send Cyral logs to Sumo Logic](https://cyral.com/docs/integration-siem#send-cyral-logs-to-sumo-logic). After configuring the collection,
you can [install](https://help.sumologic.com/05Search/Library/Apps-in-Sumo-Logic/Install-Apps-from-the-Library) the SumoLogic App from Cyral from the App Catalog
and use the same source category configured while creating the source used for your Cyral logs.
